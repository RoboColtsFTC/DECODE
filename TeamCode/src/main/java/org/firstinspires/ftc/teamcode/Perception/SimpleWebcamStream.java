/**
 * This OpMode initializes a webcam and starts a video stream to the Robot Controller.
 * It demonstrates how to manually control the stream using the gamepad.
 * This version is configured for a 1280x800 resolution and MJPEG stream format
 * to achieve a higher frame rate. Note that not all webcams support 120 FPS
 * at this resolution. The FTC SDK will negotiate the closest available frame rate.
 *
 * SETUP:
 * 1. Connect a webcam to your robot's control hub that supports these settings.
 * 2. In the Robot Configuration on the Driver Station, add the webcam and name it "Webcam 1".
 *
 * USAGE:
 * 1. Initialize this OpMode from the Driver Station.
 * 2. A live video feed will appear on the Robot Controller screen (if you have one connected)
 * or can be viewed using `scrcpy`.
 * 3. To see the stream on the Driver Station, touch the three-dot menu button and
 * select "Camera Stream" while the OpMode is initializing.
 * 4. Press the START button on the Driver Station to begin the OpMode.
 * 5. Use the D-pad Down on gamepad 1 to stop the stream.
 * 6. Use the D-pad Up on gamepad 1 to resume the stream.
